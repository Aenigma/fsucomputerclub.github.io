Welcome to the new Computer Club site! It's been re-written using Jekyll but we've managed to keep the same styling as before.

This will allow for others to submit posts via Github easily and act as a lightweight content management system.
In fact, to submit content you can do it straight from Github without setting up Jekyll at all!

If you want to submit a new post, all you have to do is click
[this](https://github.com/FSUComputerClub/fsucomputerclub.github.io/new/master/_posts) or go to the `_posts` directory
and click `New File`.

You can follow the format in another post to write it correctly. But, here are the steps:

1. Use a filename like `2016-01-01-my-title-for-post.md` where date is given in YYYY-MM-DDDD and you can use a variety
 of file formats like `.md`, `.textile`, or `.html`

2. You should make sure you have the [Jekyll Frontmatter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) written
to define some metadata. Make sure you put your name as `author` and have the `date` formatted correctly.

3. Write some content in your chosen format.

4. Write a descriptive commit message and submit it

5. Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/FSUComputerClub/fsucomputerclub.github.io/pull/new/master) to the repository
from the forked repo Github created for you.

Of course, if you want to make more complicated things, you may want to install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
